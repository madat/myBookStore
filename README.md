# myBookStore
a spring MVC application.
We have used spring 4 in this application. If required we can change it to Spring 3, as we have not used Spring 4 specific features.
This application handles various asptects of MVC, It has a very basic UI and for simplicity it does not interact with DB.
But we can easily replace our service to with some DAO or DB service class.
It uses mostly annotation driven features of Spring.

Enhancements in future : REST integration
                         Spring Hibernate
